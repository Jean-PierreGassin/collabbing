## About Collabbing

Collabbing is a tool that allows people to come together and collaborate (better) on ideas and new products.

Collabbing brings developers together to work on ideas - you simply post an idea and wait for applicants or apply to work on an idea and wait to be accepted. Ideas posted must be of a tech-based nature and that's the only limitation.
